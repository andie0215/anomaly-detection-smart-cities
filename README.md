# The Past and Present of Predictive Models for Anomaly Detection in Smart Cities

💾 Here you'll find my master's degree thesis documentation.

Its purpose is to approach some predictive models for anomaly detection in smart cities.

In the code section, you'll find how I used the energy consumption dataset for buildings in Barcelona 🏛️.

> The data exploration and processing was made using Pandas and PySpark. 
>
> The supervised and unsupervised machine learning was made using Pandas.

**Keywords**: Systematic Review, Predictive Models, XAI, Anomaly Detection, Smart Cities, Energy Consumption in buildings.
